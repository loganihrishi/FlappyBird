## Why I Built This

I built this game because I was feeling nostalgic and wanted to learn Lua. What better way to combine those two things than by creating a game? Flappy Bird is simple yet engaging, which made it the perfect choice for exploring game development fundamentals.

To complete the full nostalgic experience, I included the track **On & On** as the background music. It adds the perfect vibe to relive the joy of classic Flappy Bird gameplay.
